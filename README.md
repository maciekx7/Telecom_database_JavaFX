# Telecom_database_desktopApp
Desktop App in JavaFX which uses telecom Oracle Database (placed on server, if you want to use it for yourself, create own database from DatabaseScript)


You can see that user password in databse is not encrypted. It's not a mistake. Original project was created on my University server which not allowed me to use DB_CRYPTO. In real life that field SHOULD be encrypted.


SQLScript is not up to date. Sorry for that. I will update project with latest version as soon as possible.
